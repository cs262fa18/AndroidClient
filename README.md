Our goal is to create a platform for monitoring time employees spend on various business projects. When working on projects with large teams, it can be hard to keep track of how much time each member puts in since employees can be working on multiple projects at one time. This application seeks to give team members and project managers a simple, concise place to see how their time is being used. Our application will allow team members to select a project and record time to it. We will have a start/stop button that can be used to record time as it's happening. Also, another option that we would like to implement is a way to retroactively enter time spent that the user either forgot or was unable to record.

While this is the main core of our application, there are some other features that we'd like to implement if there is time. One of these is a built-in way to sort projects by the amount of time a user has spent on them. Letting project managers see statistics on the projects they are in charge of would also be a great addition. Another possible feature is an aggregate data display that summarizes various pieces of data from local time entries or different users. If time allows, we could also implement a feature where users can view the summary in a graph or a chart.

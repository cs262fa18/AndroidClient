Our goal is to create a platform for monitoring time spent doing
various activities (e.g. gaming, studying, sleeping, etc.). When getting into daily habits and routines, it can be hard to grasp how much time you're really spending on different activities. This app seeks to give users who want to see how their time is used a simple, concise place to do so. Out app will have multiple options for keeping track of time. We will have a start/stop button that can be used to record time as it's happening. Another option that we would like to implement is a way to retroactively enter time spent that the user either forgot or was unable to record.

While this is the main core of our application, there are some 
other features that we'd like to implement if there is time. A built-in way to sort time spent by various activities without requiring the user to enter it as text or a specific description is one such feature - either via a drop-down menu or category selection before the time is entered. Another possible feature is an aggregate data display to summarize various pieces of data either from multiple local time entries or different users.

Our goal is to create a platform for monitoring time spent on various buisness projects that can be managed by a project manager. When working on projects with large teams, it can be hard to keep track of how much time each member puts in and on what project they are wroking on. This app seeks to give team members and project managers who want to see how their time is used a simple, concise place to do so. Our app will allow team members to chose from a series of projects to add time to them. We will have a start/stop button that can be used to record time as it's happening. Another option that we would like to implement is a way to retroactively enter time spent that the user either forgot or was unable to record. 

While this is the main core of our application, there are some other features that we'd like to implement if there is time. A built-in way to sort time spent by various projects and let the project managers see statsics on the projects they are in charge of. Another possible feature is an aggregate data display to summarize various pieces of data either from multiple local time entries or different users. If time allows, we could implement a feature where users can view the summary in a graph or a chart.

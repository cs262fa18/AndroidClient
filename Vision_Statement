Our goal is to create a platform for monitoring time spent doing
various activities (e.g. gaming, studying, sleeping, etc.). From
a systems perspective, our ideal setup would be to have multiple
options for keeping track of time. The primary method would be to
have a start/stop button that can be used to record time as it's
happening. Another option that we would like to implement is a way
to retroactively enter time spent that the user either forgot to
record or was not able to. 

While this is the main core of our application, there are some 
other features that we'd like to implement. First on this list is
a built-in way to sort time spent by various activities without
requiring the user to enter it as text or a specific description.
Either via a drop-down menu or category selection before the time
is entered. Another possible feature is an aggregate data
display to summarize various pieces of data either from multiple
local time entries or different users.
